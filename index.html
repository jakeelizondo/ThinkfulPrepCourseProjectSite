        <h1 id="intro"> Hi! My name is Jake. Great to meet you!</h1>
        <p>I am a former digital marketer turned software developer, currently based in Durham, North Carolina. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to build tools that solve problems and are intuitively designed with the end user experience in mind. With my background and experience in digital marketing, I am passionate about designing websites to perform well and convert, as well as provide a positive experience across devices and operating systems. Someone on an iPhone 8 with a 3g connection deserves a positive user experience just as much as someone on the latest Samsung phone and 5g access.

          <div>
            <p class="left-align">I enjoy making, constructing, and building things. I always find myself wondering “how did they build that?” “why didn’t they add this?” etc. when I use software applications or platforms. I want to build tools and platforms that help other people accomplish their goals. What I love about software is the job structure, the community, and the opportunity for continuous education. I love working with a group or team (I’ve always preferred doubles tennis to singles!) and having the opportunity to both learn from other people as well as help them if I can.</p>
            <p class="left-align"> 
            I also love that the community is so open source minded and collaborative. I use many platforms that are free to use and simply maintained by a devoted community, like Roll20 for Dungeons and Dragons online. It is a dream of mine to one day contribute to an open source project that I am passionate about like this. </p>
            <p class="left-align">
            The most important thing for me, however, is the opportunity and desire for continued learning. I want to work in a field where I am interested in what I am working on and where I feel a desire and motivation to always be learning something new. I hope to find elements of all of these motivating factors in my roles as a software developer.
